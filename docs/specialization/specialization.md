# Measures of Specialization
Appears to emerge when a network is resource-constrained?
## Q-Metric
Graph-based. 
Measures how clustered nodes are compared to a graph connected at random. 
## Importance & Coherence

Importance measures how crucial the module is for performance by turning it off. 

Coherence measures how consistently the module activates for a certain type of feature and remains inactive for others. 

## RDM Distance
Distance between activity patterns across different stimuli. So, it's dependent on being able to segment the data well. 

## Information Theory Measures

### Mutual Information
Amount of shared info between variables. Specialized encoders maximize utility, minimize irrelevant input information leakage.

### Refined Local Learning Coefficients
Measure model complexity based on geometric properties of the lsos landscape.
